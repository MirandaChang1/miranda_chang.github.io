My name is Miranda and I am a Masters student in Clinical Psychology (Neuropsychology Specialization) at Simon Fraser University, supervised by [Dr. Molly Cairncross](https://www.cairncrosslab.com/). I am also currently a Senior Research Assistant at the Memory and Perception Lab in the University of Toronto, working with [Dr. Morgan Barense](https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/). I earned my Honours Bachelor of Science with a specialization in Psychology Research and a major in Neuroscience at UofT.

Research Overview
======
Currently, my graduate research focuses on the prevalence and biopsychosocial risk and protective factors of subjective cognitive decline, as well as the discrepancy between self-reported and objective memory decline, in adults and older adults with a remote history of mTBI using the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging dataset. 

My undergraduate research with Dr. Morgan Barense focused on interventions to improve spatial memory of novel routes and autobiographical memory in healthy older adults and individuals at-risk of mild cognitive impairment. My undergraduate thesis investigated how spontaneous retrieval of spatial context scaffolds the episodic richness of weak real-world autobiographical memories. I also worked with [Dr. Morris Moscovitch](https://neuropsychologylab.psych.utoronto.ca/index.html) on projects that examined the mental representation of remote and recent faces in  healthy aging, as well as the differential impact of schematic versus categorical prior knowledge in older adults. Currently at UofT, I am involved in designing smartphone-based digital reminiscence interventions to improve episodic memory and quality of life in cognitively impaired populations.
